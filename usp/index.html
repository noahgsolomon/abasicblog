        <h2>Consumer Intent</h2>
        <p>
          Consumers do not want to search and look into your entire website for
          10 minutes before purchasing an item. They want the experience to be
          simple and unique.
         
        </p>
        <p>
          your Unique Selling Proposition (USP) should be short and concise and
          describe what purpose your product serves.
         
        </p>
        <p>
          your Call To Action (CTA) and USP should be clear in the start screen
          of your website.
         
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal should be to give your customers certainty that theyre in the
          right place, give your customers a quick pitch. Your CTA needs to be
          concise so that your customers do not get bored and leave your page.
         
          <br />
          1.) Save your customers time. <br />
          <br />
          2.) Make them feel theyre saving money on your product or that they
          will make money with your product. <br />
          <br />
          3.) Give the customer certainty that your product will benefit them
        </p>

        <h2>Finding Your USP</h2>
        <p>
          In order to find your Unique Selling Proposition, you must understand
          who your target audience is. This will help you understand who your
          competitors are as well as how to cater to your target audience
         
        </p>
        <p>
          Develop a unique process so you can repeat it. <br />
          <br />
          A --------------> B <br />
          A = consumer <br />
          ----> = identifying problem and what experience the customer would get
          'working with you' <br />
          B = purchase
         
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          your USP needs to be just that... UNIQUE. yes it is a good idea to
          learn from your competition but your goal should be to bring something
          new to the table. the user experience and interface needs to be
          AMAZING to give your brand more credibility and your customer more
          certainty.
         
        </p>
        <p>
          Get in the customers shoes. Focus on the buying experience. Make it
          ENJOYABLE not like a process.
         
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not seek to solve a problem for everyone, just focus on your target
          audience and what problem they need to have solved
          <br />
          (be clear in identifying problem).

          When selling someone elses product, you can either dropship it or
          wholesale.

                needed upfront (not pay per order).

                    Is your product locally available? If it

            <p>
                To clarify, competition is not a bad thing.
                it shows that there is demand in your market. 
                To find your competitors you can search long tail
                and short tail keywords about your market. <br>
                You can use applications like SemRush to see your 
                competitions traffic volume and the amount of backlinks they
                have and where their traffic is coming from.
                It is important to see their UX/UI, and their USP and how well
                they display their CTA.
